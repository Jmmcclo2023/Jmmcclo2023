Hello, I’m Jalen McCloud

I am a Clemson Univerity computer science graduate.
Welcome to my GitHub profile where I will (hopefully) store some cool projects.
Right now, I am building Django APIs while studying for a MongoDB certification.
I plan on diving into procedural generation and 3D modeling sometime in the future.
(Just because I am really interested in it)
Feel free to follow my journey!
